# Hide Client Player Armor

A Forge 1.8.9 mod which does exactly what its label suggests; it prevents your worn armor from being rendered.

I made this specifically to support [NEU] capes, because apparently every other SkyBlock mod with this feature
has yet to come up with the concept of suppressing the cape angle transforms on NEU capes when your armor
is hidden, but you're still wearing a chestplate.

Why? Who knows! But it bothered me enough to finally make this.

(support for vanilla capes is not guaranteed, but *should* (hopefully) work.)
